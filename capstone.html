				<p>Are you a creative looking to trigger work session? If so, you've come to the right place. This tools was made to generate images loosely related to a topic that you can use as a starting point for a creative work.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="instructionSection">
				<h3>How it works</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Start by searching for word or short phrase.</li>
						<li>Inspiration Trigger will first find 10 words related to your search. </li>
						<li>For each of those words, it will then search Flickr and return up to 5 images per related word.</li>
						<li>Remember, all the photos returned are those that are publically available and posted by the Flickr user community. So there's really no telling what sorts of images you might get back</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="instructionSection">
				<h3>What can I do with it?</h3>
				<p>Once you have a list of photos, choose one or more and start to freestyle. Use the images as writing prompts, as the trigger for freestyle flow practice, character inspiration, or just use the images as a starting place to let your creativity roam.</p>
