						<p>Table topics are a chance to practice impromptu speaking.</p>
						<p>The purpose is to practice organizing our thoughts on the fly. This practice helps us to thrive in those moments when life calls on us to rise to occasion from interviews, to dates, meetings, and much more.</p>

						<h3>How it works</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The goal is to speak off the cuff for 1-2 minutes based on the images returned.</li>
								<li>Search for a word or short phrase.</li>
								<li>The Table Topics Generator will first find 5 words related to your search. </li>
								<li>For each word returned, it will then search Flickr and return up to 3 images.</li>
								<li>Use the content from the images as a starting point for you talk, and take it wherever you want from there.</li>
								<li>You don't have to incorporate all the images, but you can try if you like.</li>
								<li>Remember, this is an exercise in imagination so feel free to make up a story or speak on any subject that comes to mind.</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>*Discaimer - User discretion is advized*</h3>
						<p>All the photos returned here are publically available, posted, and tagged by the Flickr community. Thus there's no gaurantee of what sorts of images may be returned. A content filter has been applied to reduce adult content, but not all content is tagged appropriately.</p>
